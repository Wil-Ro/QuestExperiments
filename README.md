# Quest Experiments

## What is this?
Whilst I'm at university I have a Quest 2 and a low powered laptop. My aim is to see what the best thing I can make for the Quest is with this limited setup. I'm using Godot for this as its absolutely tiny and hopefully quite easy for my laptop to run.

I'm not sure what this file will actually contain yet but most likely a collection of interactable objects in a small vr world.

## Set up
To use this file you will need to download Android Studio, NDK and a few other things, you can find the exact instructions I followed [here](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/exporting_for_android.html#doc-exporting-for-android), the file should come with the Godot Oculus library but if you need it for any reason you can find it [here](https://github.com/GodotVR/godot-oculus-mobile-asset).

If you want to use the file on a Quest you will need to compile it and add it to your device, you may need a developer account for this.
